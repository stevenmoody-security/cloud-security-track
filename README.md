# Cloud Security Track (AWS)

Portfolio artifacts from AWS cloud security training: flAWS/flAWS2 (misconfiguration scenarios) + AWS Workshops (Security Hub / AWS Config).
Target roles: Cloud Security Analyst → Junior Cloud Security Engineer.

## Weekly cadence
- Tue: flAWS / flAWS2
- Thu: AWS Workshops (Security Hub / AWS Config)
- Sun: batch commit artifacts + update tracker

## Repo structure
- `artifacts/` — write-ups (primary deliverable)
- `evidence/` — redacted screenshots/snippets referenced by artifacts
- `tracker.md` — index of completed work
- `templates/` — standardized formats for speed and consistency

## Safety rules
- No credentials, tokens, or private keys.
- Redact evidence aggressively.
- Prefer a learning-only AWS account for labs.
