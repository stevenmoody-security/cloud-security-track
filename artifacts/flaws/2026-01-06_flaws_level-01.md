Date: 2026-01-06
Track: flAWS
Timebox: 60-90 min

## Objective (1 sentence)
Complete flAWS Level 01 and document the misconfiguration, guardrail, and detection signals.

## What failed (misconfig/control gap)
- <What was misconfigured?>
- <What control should have existed?>

## Blast radius
- <What data/resource exposure or privilege impact was possible?>

## Attacker path (high-level, non-instructional)
- <Step 1: discovery>
- <Step 2: access>
- <Step 3: impact>

## Guardrail (prevent at scale)
- <What preventative control would stop this class of issue?>
- <How would you enforce it org-wide?>

## Detection (signals + 1 detection idea)
Signals/sources:
- <CloudTrail / Config / Security Hub / VPC Flow / S3 access logs / etc.>

Detection idea:
- <One concise detection idea tied to the misconfig>

## Evidence (redacted)
Evidence folder: `evidence/2026-01-06/flaws/level-01/`
- <01_...> — <what it shows>
- <02_...> — <what it shows>

## Lessons learned (max 3)
1) <lesson>
2) <lesson>
3) <lesson>

## Interview prompts (60–90 sec each)
1) How would you prevent this misconfiguration at scale?
2) What log sources would you use to detect this exposure?
3) What is the fastest containment action if you found this in production?
